        <h1>Privacy Policy for EPIC (Email Priority Instant Classifier)</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: August 22, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Email Priority Instant Classifier (EPIC) is a Chrome extension designed to help users classify their emails efficiently using AI-powered solutions. EPIC integrates seamlessly with Gmail to provide context-aware classification of emails, helping you decide which emails to prioritize and which can wait.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>EPIC may collect and store the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email metadata for classification purposes (e.g., sender, subject, timestamp).</li>
            <li>Your classification records, including priority labels and any custom settings you have configured.</li>
            <li>Custom prompts you enter (up to 100 words) to guide the AI classifier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The data collected is used strictly to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classify emails based on importance and urgency.</li>
            <li>Provide visualization of email status across different categories.</li>
            <li>Allow you to view, manage, or delete up to 100 stored records.</li>
            <li>Improve the AI classification model based on your custom prompts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>EPIC does not store your email content on external servers. All records are stored locally in your browser's storage and can be managed directly from the extension. We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your data locally.</p>

        <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
        <p>EPIC requires the following permissions to function properly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gmail access:</strong> To read email metadata for classification purposes only.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To store classification records and custom prompts locally.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are solely used for the features described above and will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can view, manage, or delete your stored classification records directly in the extension. You can also modify or remove any custom prompts you have entered at any time.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The effective date will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
